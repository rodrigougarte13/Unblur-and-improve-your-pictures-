# Unblur-and-improve-your-pictures-

This algorith aims to correct blurry photos, using advanced image processing techniques and a UNet architecture with Python and TensorFlow. Its final scope is to improve image clarity and detail significantly, with potential applications in digital photography and image analysis or as preprocess step for a ESRGAN algorithm.
The first try was limited to computing capabilties, therefore a resizing of images has to be made, we  saw slight improvements. This v1 of the model was completed, however, I am on engoing research to provide a more comprehensive model that handles any picture resolution and provides image correction. The 3 improvements are: increasing the size of the training images, making the blurr function harsher, so the model can correct even blurrier photos and finally make the model accept any resolution. 

Ths is the best result, we we can see there is evident correction of the blurriness of the fish:.
